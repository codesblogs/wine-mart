Step 7: You can either use JSON as a downloaded file inside the project or you can fetch it as a API
// In my case I downloaded the file & used as a file named "Wine-data.json".

// Basically I used JSON.map() to retrieve the data

Step 9: Once all the data fetched you are all set to go for Chart representaion
// Build the chart as per given data in "Apache ECharts" and insert the retrieved data as per requirement specially in Array format.
